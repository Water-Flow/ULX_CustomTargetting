ULX_CustomTargetting
==============
By Voodoo(STEAM_0:1:28607710) 


To Install
==============

Drag and drop into garrysmod's addon folder
\GarrysMod\garrysmod\addons\

Note(s):
==============


This addon lets ulx users target by specific keywords for certain gamemodes as defined in 

[sh_definitions.lua](sh_definitions.lua)

For example, by default ULX will not allow a user to use the command "slap" to target Terrortown's traitors. Installing this addon
comes with support for Terrortown and Jailbreak keywords. Such as but not limited to "Traitors, Innocents, Spectators", and "Prisioners, Warden, Guards".

Thus "slap" would now target any: ALIVE, CAN_TOUCH, traitors. 


Example by typing in chat

```

!slap #traitors
```

Outcome:

```
[User] slapped: Bot1, Bot2, Bot3
```

**WARNING:** Careful consideration should be used when using such a keyword for any and all commands.
